🧬 Project: The Central Dogma
I wrote a script that simulates how a cell works:

Transcription: Changing DNA to RNA.

Translation: Turning the code into a Protein sequence.

Why this matters: This is how scientists study viruses (like COVID-19) to create vaccines!
this project is my first step in using Python to solve Biological problems. I am currently learning how to handle DNA sequences and translate them into proteins
🧪 Methods
File Parsing: The script reads raw .txt genomic data.

Pattern Matching: Used to identify specific motifs within a sequence.

Metrics: Calculates GC content to evaluate genomic stability.
